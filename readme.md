## unnamed Descent Port/ICDP

A modified version of the Chocolate Descent engine Descent game. Will support
many new features eventually.

Status:
Only Descent 1 is supported at the moment, but Descent 2 support will be
rolled in future updates. High resolution software rendering is supported,
and the software renderer is multithreaded in order to support this. 

Building:
See building.txt for details. The project has been successfully built on 
Windows using Visual Studio 2019, Linux with gnu make and gcc, and macOS 
with GNU make and clang.

Running:
ICDP needs game data to run. At the moment, ICDP will only work with HOG and
PIG files from Descent's PC commercial release, versions 1.4 or 1.5.
